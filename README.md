# String-Elements-Counter-
Answer to a usual question for classes. How do I sort the frequency of elements in a string in python? How do I print it at the end? 
If you have the beginner task to write a sorting and display code with only very basic tools of python, e.g. no sorted() or compounds, 
this may lead you to understand the basic principles of the task before you. Best used as a help while trying to write your own code for 
a similiar task
